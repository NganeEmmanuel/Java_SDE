### Course Outline: **Java Programming & Software Engineering Fundamentals**

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Java and Software Engineering**

- **Objective:** Familiarize students with the Java programming environment and introduce software engineering concepts.
- Topics:
  - Overview of Java: JVM, JRE, JDK, installation, and setup.
  - Introduction to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) â€“ (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code).
  - What is Software Engineering? Overview of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
  - Overview of Java application in the SDLC.
  - Project: Setting up a "Hello World" Java project, compiling, and running Java programs.

#### **Module 2: Basic Programming Concepts in Java**

- **Objective:** Cover the fundamental building blocks of Java programming.
- Topics:
  - Variables, data types, and operators.
  - Input and Output in Java.
  - Basic control structures (if-else, switch, loops).
  - Introduction to debugging and testing: Using print statements and basic IDE debuggers.
  - Software engineering basics: Requirements gathering for a small program (e.g., a calculator).
  - Project: Building a simple calculator or temperature converter.

#### **Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- **Objective:** Introduce and apply OOP principles in Java.
- Topics:
  - Classes and Objects: Understanding `class` structure and `object` instantiation.
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
  - Access modifiers (public, private, protected).
  - Constructors, getters, and setters.
  - Basic UML for software design: Class diagrams.
  - Software engineering: Introduction to design principles and why OOP is used in software design.
  - Project: Create a simple "library system" with classes for `Book`, `Library`, and `User`.

#### **Module 4: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**

- **Objective:** Develop a foundation in data structures and introduce algorithmic thinking.
- Topics:
  - Arrays, Lists, and basic Collection Framework (ArrayList, LinkedList).
  - Introduction to sorting and searching algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, binary search).
  - Exception handling in Java.
  - Software engineering: Emphasis on efficiency and performance analysis.
  - Project: Extend the "library system" to include data storage and sorting of books by title, author, etc.

#### **Module 5: Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

- **Objective:** Explore the SDLC stages and integrate it with Java project development.
- Topics:
  - Overview of SDLC models (Waterfall, Agile, etc.).
  - Requirement gathering and functional vs. non-functional requirements.
  - Basic project planning and dividing tasks into phases.
  - Software testing and debugging techniques.
  - Project: Collect requirements, design, and implement a "To-Do List" application using a basic SDLC approach.

#### **Module 6: Intermediate Java Programming Concepts**

- **Objective:** Introduce intermediate Java concepts and build larger, more complex systems.
- Topics:
  - File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
  - Java collections (HashMap, HashSet, TreeSet).
  - Multithreading and concurrency basics.
  - Introduction to JavaFX for GUI development.
  - Software engineering: Introduction to version control with Git.
  - Project: Build a simple address book with a GUI interface and file storage.

#### **Module 7: Software Design and Architecture**

- **Objective:** Teach the importance of software design and architecture in building scalable applications.
- Topics:
  - Understanding software architecture patterns (Layered, Client-Server, N-Tier).
  - Introduction to design patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
  - Refactoring code for maintainability.
  - Project: Apply a layered architecture to build a "simple e-commerce system" with classes for `Product`, `Order`, and `User`.

#### **Module 8: Database Integration with Java**

- **Objective:** Introduce relational databases and SQL, and connect Java applications to a database.
- Topics:
  - Introduction to databases (MySQL, SQLite) and SQL basics.
  - JDBC for database connectivity in Java.
  - Basic CRUD operations in Java using JDBC.
  - Software engineering: Database design principles and normalizing tables.
  - Project: Extend the e-commerce system to store data in a database.

#### **Module 9: Advanced Software Engineering Concepts**

- **Objective:** Explore advanced software engineering concepts such as testing, maintenance, and deployment.
- Topics:
  - Software testing: Unit testing with JUnit and basic test-driven development (TDD).
  - Code reviews and version control best practices.
  - Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) basics.
  - Documentation and user guides for software.
  - Project: Write unit tests for the e-commerce application and practice CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

#### **Module 10: Capstone Project**

- **Objective:** Apply all the learned concepts to build a complete application.
- Topics:
  - Project planning, requirement gathering, and task breakdown.
  - Full SDLC application: Design, implementation, testing, and documentation.
  - Integrate all components (OOP, file I/O, database, GUI, design patterns).
  - Final Project: Build a "Student Management System" or a "Hotel Booking System" that incorporates all learned Java and software engineering skills.

### Tips for Teaching

- **Hands-on practice:** Every concept should be paired with coding exercises or small projects to reinforce learning.
- **Project-based learning:** Use progressively complex projects to keep students motivated and allow them to apply software engineering principles in real-world scenarios.
- **Focus on understanding:** Emphasize the *why* behind each software engineering principle so that students learn not just how to code, but how to build well-designed, maintainable systems.
- **Regular review and recap:** Recap previous lessons to help students build a strong foundation, as Java and software engineering are cumulative topics.

This course outline aims to balance technical skills with the structured approach of software engineering, setting up students for both Java development and structured problem-solving in software projects. --->
